A collection of customizations useful when allowing users to pay by direct transfer for Paid Memberships Pro levels.

== Description ==

Adds a radio option to checkout to pay by credit card or PayPal now or pay by direct transfer.

Users who choose to pay by direct transfer will have their order to "pending" status.

Users with a pending order will not have access based on their level.

After you receive and confirm the payment, you can edit the order to change the status to "success", which will give the user access.

An email is sent to the user RE the status change.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-pay-by-direct-transfer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Change your Payment Settings to the "Pay by Direct Transfer" gateway and make sure to set the "Instructions" with instructions for how to pay by check. Save.
